# C4 Level 3 — Components

![Core components](L3_CoreComponents.svg)

![Webview components](L3_WebviewComponents.svg)

The Rust core decomposes into one crate per component. Each crate is the
unit of agent ownership (see [`domain-ownership.md`](domain-ownership.md)).

## Dependency rule

> A component may depend on `common` and on no other component, except
> where this document explicitly grants the dependency.

`common` holds the shared types and trait definitions. Anything else
crossing a boundary either flows through trait objects defined in
`common`, or via the orchestrator wiring everything together.

The explicit cross-component dependencies are:

| Crate | May depend on |
|---|---|
| `common` | (nothing in this workspace) |
| `audio-capture` | `common` |
| `vad-chunker` | `common` |
| `asr-runtime` | `common`, `model-registry`, `settings` |
| `diarizer` | `common`, `model-registry` |
| `summariser` | `common`, `model-registry`, `settings`, `persistence` |
| `persistence` | `common` |
| `model-registry` | `common`, `settings` |
| `settings` | `common` |
| `orchestrator` | `common`, `audio-capture`, `vad-chunker`, `asr-runtime`, `diarizer`, `persistence`, `settings` |
| `ipc-bridge` | `common`, `orchestrator`, `persistence`, `summariser`, `settings` |
| `app-main` (bin) | `common`, `orchestrator`, `ipc-bridge`, `settings` |

Any PR adding an edge not in this table requires an architecture-doc
update in the same commit.

## Rust core components

### `common`
**Crate:** `crates/common`
**Owns:** shared types (`Segment`, `AudioChunk`, `MeetingId`,
`MeetingMeta`), trait definitions (`AsrBackend`, `Diarizer`,
`Summariser`), shared error types.

**Stable surface.** Changes here ripple to every other crate. Treat as
the architectural contract — bumping it is a coordinated change.

### `audio-capture`
**Crate:** `crates/audio-capture`
**Owns:** the audio device, sample-rate negotiation, the capture ring
buffer, device enumeration for the settings UI.

**Inputs:** start/stop commands (from orchestrator); device id (from
settings).
**Outputs:** an async `Stream<Item = AudioFrame>` of f32 samples at the
internal sample rate (16 kHz mono).

### `vad-chunker`
**Crate:** `crates/vad-chunker`
**Owns:** Silero VAD model lifecycle (via `vad-rs`), the smoothing
wrapper, silence-detection heuristics.

**Inputs:** frame stream from `audio-capture`.
**Outputs:** an async `Stream<Item = AudioChunk>` where each chunk is
bounded by detected silence ≥ the configured threshold and carries
`{start_ms, end_ms, samples}`.

### `asr-runtime`
**Crate:** `crates/asr-runtime`
**Owns:** llama-cpp-2 mtmd binding, the Qwen3-ASR model, the prompt /
template details required to drive it as ASR.

**Implements:** `AsrBackend` from `common`.
**Inputs:** an `AudioChunk`.
**Outputs:** `Vec<Segment>` for that chunk.

Sub-30s chunks may be padded to 30s — that's a known llama.cpp mtmd
constraint (see the specification §12). Padding cost is accepted in v1.

### `diarizer`
**Crate:** `crates/diarizer`
**Owns:** sherpa-onnx binding, the embedding + clustering pipeline.

**Implements:** `Diarizer` from `common`.
**Inputs:** the full buffered audio + the segment array from ASR.
**Outputs:** mutates segments in place, setting `speaker_id`.

Post-hoc only. Not in the live pipeline; runs after the recording stops
or as a user-triggered re-diarize.

### `summariser`
**Crate:** `crates/summariser`
**Owns:** llama-cpp-2 text-LLM lifecycle, summarisation prompts, the
optional external-LLM dispatcher (Ollama / LM Studio).

**Implements:** `Summariser` from `common`.
**Inputs:** transcript + notes (read via `persistence`).
**Outputs:** a markdown summary written via `persistence`.

### `model-registry`
**Crate:** `crates/model-registry`
**Owns:** the on-disk model cache, the model-manifest schema, download
+ resume + hash verification, version metadata exposed to other
components.

The only component allowed to write to the model directory.

### `persistence`
**Crate:** `crates/persistence`
**Owns:** the per-meeting folder layout, the libsql index schema and
migrations, Opus audio encoding, Tiptap JSON I/O.

**Inputs:** typed write commands from orchestrator and IPC bridge.
**Outputs:** typed read responses; emits no events itself.

The only component allowed to read or write under `{app-data}/meetings/`
and `{app-data}/index.db`.

### `orchestrator`
**Crate:** `crates/orchestrator`
**Owns:** the live recording state machine. Wires `audio-capture →
vad-chunker → asr-runtime → persistence`, kicks off `diarizer` on stop,
emits typed events (transcript-segment-appended, meter-level,
state-changed) that the IPC bridge forwards to the webview.

**Thorniest crate.** Any change to the live pipeline lives here.
Parallel agents working on capture / VAD / ASR cannot independently
change the orchestrator's wiring — that's an orchestration-owner
decision and needs an architecture-doc update.

### `settings`
**Crate:** `crates/settings`
**Owns:** the settings schema, validation, change notifications.
Persisted via `tauri-plugin-store`.

Single source of truth for runtime configuration. Other components read
settings via this crate; nobody else parses the store directly.

### `ipc-bridge`
**Crate:** `crates/ipc-bridge`
**Owns:** the Tauri command + event surface. tauri-specta generates
TypeScript types consumed by the webview.

**The only crate that knows about Tauri APIs.** Every other crate is
free of Tauri imports — this is what makes the core testable without a
running Tauri app.

### `app-main` (bin)
**Crate:** `src-tauri/` (Tauri convention)
**Owns:** the Tauri main binary, tray icon, window management, process
lifetime. Wires the components into a running app.

The thinnest crate — code here should mostly be construction and
plumbing.

## Webview components

The webview is small enough that ownership maps to directories rather
than packages.

| Component | Lives in | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Notes editor | `ui/src/editor/` | Tiptap editor, markdown shortcuts, paragraph-anchor extension. |
| Transcript pane | `ui/src/transcript/` | Live-appending transcript view, hover/click cross-reference. |
| Meeting shell | `ui/src/shell/` | Window chrome, start/stop/pause, audio meter, meeting list. |
| IPC client | `ui/src/ipc/` | Typed wrapper around `invoke` + `listen`. Generated stubs from tauri-specta live here. |
| UI state store | `ui/src/state/` | Zustand store. Derived UI state only — transient. |

The webview's source of truth for typed messages is the generated
`bindings.ts` produced by tauri-specta. Hand-edits to that file are not
allowed.

## What lives where — quick reference

- **Editing audio capture buffer size:** `audio-capture` crate.
- **Tweaking VAD silence threshold:** `vad-chunker` crate + `settings`
  schema.
- **Changing ASR prompt template:** `asr-runtime` crate.
- **Changing summarisation system prompt default:** `settings` crate +
  `summariser` prompt builder.
- **Adding a new meeting metadata field:** `common` (type), `persistence`
  (storage), `ipc-bridge` (surface).
- **Adding a new Tauri command:** `ipc-bridge` crate. tauri-specta
  regenerates the TS bindings.
- **Adding a new event from backend to webview:** `ipc-bridge` defines
  the event; `orchestrator` (or the relevant crate) emits via an
  abstraction in `common`.
