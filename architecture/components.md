# C4 Level 3 — Components

![Core components](L3_CoreComponents.svg)

![Webview components](L3_WebviewComponents.svg)

The Rust core decomposes into one crate per component. Each crate is the
unit of agent ownership (see [`domain-ownership.md`](domain-ownership.md)).

## Dependency rule

> A component may depend on `common` and on no other component, except
> where this document explicitly grants the dependency.

`common` holds the shared types and trait definitions. Anything else
crossing a boundary either flows through trait objects defined in
`common`, or via the orchestrator wiring everything together.

The explicit cross-component dependencies and the phase each crate first
appears in:

| Crate | First phase | May depend on |
|---|---|---|
| `common` | 1 | (nothing in this workspace) |
| `audio-capture` | 1 | `common` |
| `vad-chunker` | 2 | `common` |
| `asr-runtime` | 2 | `common`, `model-registry`, `settings` |
| `diarizer` | 6 | `common`, `model-registry` |
| `summariser` | 5 | `common`, `model-registry`, `settings`, `persistence` |
| `persistence` | 1 (minimal) → 4 (full) | `common` |
| `model-registry` | 2 | `common`, `settings` |
| `settings` | 1 | `common` |
| `orchestrator` | 1 (minimal) → 2 (live pipeline) | `common`, `audio-capture`, `vad-chunker`, `asr-runtime`, `diarizer`, `persistence`, `settings` |
| `ipc-bridge` | 1 | `common`, `orchestrator`, `persistence`, `summariser`, `settings` |
| `app-main` (bin) | 1 | `common`, `orchestrator`, `ipc-bridge`, `settings` |

Any PR adding an edge not in this table requires an architecture-doc
update in the same commit.

### Crates that grow across phases

- **`persistence`** appears in Phase 1 as a minimal writer of
  `audio.opus` + `metadata.json` to a per-meeting folder. The libsql
  index, transcript/notes/summary storage, and meeting-list queries
  arrive in Phase 4.
- **`orchestrator`** appears in Phase 1 as a tiny state machine for
  start / stop / pause with the audio meter and capture lifecycle. The
  full live pipeline (VAD → ASR → transcript events → diarizer trigger)
  arrives in Phase 2.
- **`ipc-bridge`** appears in Phase 1 with start/stop/pause commands,
  device-list query, audio-meter and state-change events. Grows each
  phase as new domain surface is added.
- **`asr-runtime`** and **`vad-chunker`** both first appear in Phase 2 —
  they're a unit. Phase 1 captures audio but does not transcribe.

## Rust core components

### `common`
**Crate:** `crates/common`
**Owns:** shared types (`MeetingId`, `ModelId`, `AudioChunk`, `Segment`,
`WordTimestamp`, `MeetingMeta`, `ModelDescriptor`, `RecordingState`,
`AppEvent`, `AudioDevice`, `AudioMeterFrame`, `AudioFormat`), trait
definitions (`AsrBackend`, `Diarizer`, `Summariser`), the shared
`AppError` enum + `AppResult<T>` alias.

**Stable surface — locked.** The trait signatures and event variants in
this crate are the architectural contract that sub-agents implement
against in parallel. Changes here ripple to every other crate and
require an architecture-owner decision plus an update to this document
in the same commit. See [`agent-dispatch.md`](agent-dispatch.md) —
"Prerequisites for parallel dispatch".

### `audio-capture`
**Crate:** `crates/audio-capture`
**Owns:** the audio device, sample-rate negotiation, the capture ring
buffer, device enumeration for the settings UI.

**Inputs:** start/stop commands (from orchestrator); device id (from
settings).
**Outputs:** an async `Stream<Item = AudioFrame>` of f32 samples at the
internal sample rate (**16 kHz mono — mandated; this matches mtmd's
encoder input rate per Spike 1's Q-P0-1**, so downstream consumers do
not resample).

**Back-pressure policy:** the cpal-callback→forwarder channel is bounded
at 8 frames (drop-oldest with `tracing::warn!` on overflow); meter window
is 512 samples (~32 ms at 16 kHz, ~30 Hz emission rate).

### `vad-chunker`
**Crate:** `crates/vad-chunker`
**Owns:** Silero VAD model lifecycle (via `vad-rs`), the smoothing
wrapper, silence-detection heuristics.

**Inputs:** frame stream from `audio-capture`.
**Outputs:** an async `Stream<Item = AudioChunk>` where each chunk is
bounded by detected silence ≥ the configured threshold and carries
`{start_ms, end_ms, samples}`.

The Silero VAD ONNX file is **vendored** under `resources/silero/`, not
managed by `model-registry`. See
[`cross-cutting.md`](cross-cutting.md) — Model lifecycle.

### `asr-runtime`
**Crate:** `crates/asr-runtime`
**Owns:** llama-cpp-2 mtmd binding, the Qwen3-ASR model, the prompt /
template details required to drive it as ASR.

**Implements:** `AsrBackend` from `common`.
**Inputs:** an `AudioChunk`.
**Outputs:** `Vec<Segment>` for that chunk.

**Encoder-window constraint (confirmed by Phase 0 Spike 1).** mtmd's
audio encoder uses a fixed 30 s window. Sub-30 s inputs are
silence-padded internally and the model continues into the padded
region, hallucinating words that weren't in the audio. The `AsrBackend`
trait itself is unaffected — implementations handle the constraint.

`orchestrator` is responsible for shaping its calls to this trait
correctly. The Phase 2 default is the batched-VAD strategy with
silence-preservation (see `cross-cutting.md`, "ASR chunking
constraint"): collect VAD segments into a ≥25 s buffer, **keep the
original inter-utterance silences (zero-padded, capped at ~3 s each)**,
and only then dispatch.

**Output schema.** `asr-runtime` MUST stop generation on `</asr_text>`
in addition to EOG — Qwen3-ASR doesn't always emit EOG for sub-window
audio. See `cross-cutting.md` — ASR chunking constraint.

### `diarizer`
**Crate:** `crates/diarizer`
**Owns:** sherpa-onnx binding, the embedding + clustering pipeline.

**Implements:** `Diarizer` from `common`.
**Inputs:** the full buffered audio + the segment array from ASR.
**Outputs:** mutates segments in place, setting `speaker_id`.

Post-hoc only. Not in the live pipeline; runs after the recording stops
or as a user-triggered re-diarize.

**Binding pin (confirmed by Phase 0 Spike 4).** `sherpa-rs = 0.6.8`
(Thewh1teagle, MIT) with the `download-binaries` feature for dev and
`static` for Phase 7 bundling. The `sherpa_rs::diarize::Diarize` surface
covers everything needed; no `bindgen` direct-C wrapper required. The
k2-fsa-owned alternative crate `sherpa-onnx = 1.13.x` (Apache-2.0)
should be re-evaluated against `sherpa-rs` before Phase 6 ships.

Cluster IDs returned by the binding are arbitrary `i32`; the impl must
normalise to first-seen-order labels (`A`, `B`, …) before populating
`Segment::speaker_id`. The binding's `eyre::Result` is mapped to
`common::AppError::Inference` at the trait boundary.

### `summariser`
**Crate:** `crates/summariser`
**Owns:** llama-cpp-2 text-LLM lifecycle, summarisation prompts, the
optional external-LLM dispatcher (Ollama / LM Studio).

**Implements:** `Summariser` from `common`.
**Inputs:** transcript + notes (read via `persistence`).
**Outputs:** a markdown summary written via `persistence`.

**Chat-template handling (confirmed by Phase 0 Spike 2).** Use
`LlamaModel::chat_template(None::<&str>)` to read the GGUF's baked-in
template, then `LlamaModel::apply_chat_template(template, messages,
add_ass=true)` to render the prompt. Do NOT pull in `tokenizers` —
llama-cpp-2 covers this cleanly. If the template is missing or the
model isn't Qwen-shaped, fail the request explicitly rather than
falling back to a hand-built ChatML scaffold (the manual scaffold only
matches Qwen's template).

**Prefill must chunk by `n_batch`** — see `cross-cutting.md`, "llama.cpp
prefill batching". Long transcripts exceed `n_batch` (default 512) and
will assert otherwise.

**Use `AddBos::Never` after templating** (the template embeds the BOS
itself). Stop generation on `model.is_eog_token(token)`, which covers
both EOS and `<|im_end|>` for Qwen.

### `model-registry`
**Crate:** `crates/model-registry`
**Owns:** the on-disk model cache, the model-manifest schema, download
+ resume + hash verification, version metadata exposed to other
components.

The only component allowed to write to the model directory.

### `persistence`
**Crate:** `crates/persistence`
**Owns:** the per-meeting folder layout, the libsql index schema and
migrations, Opus audio encoding, Tiptap JSON I/O.

**Opus encoder pin.** `audiopus = "0.3.0-rc.0"` (the explicit pre-release
tag is required at workspace level; Cargo's semver does not resolve
pre-releases from a `"0.3"` constraint). Container is Ogg via the `ogg`
crate. Phase 1 writes 16 kHz mono 32 kbps.

**Inputs:** typed write commands from orchestrator and IPC bridge.
**Outputs:** typed read responses; emits no events itself.

The only component allowed to read or write under `{app-data}/meetings/`
and `{app-data}/index.db`.

**Phase 1 surface:** writes `audio.opus` (Opus 16 kHz mono 32 kbps, Ogg
container) and `metadata.json` per meeting. Pause/resume inserts zero-sample
(silent) Opus frames so decoded duration equals wall-clock duration including
pauses (±20 ms per frame). The libsql index (`index.db`) and
transcript/notes/summary storage are Phase 4.

### `orchestrator`
**Crate:** `crates/orchestrator`
**Owns:** the live recording state machine. Wires `audio-capture →
vad-chunker → asr-runtime → persistence`, kicks off `diarizer` on stop,
emits typed events (transcript-segment-appended, meter-level,
state-changed) that the IPC bridge forwards to the webview.

**Thorniest crate.** Any change to the live pipeline lives here.
Parallel agents working on capture / VAD / ASR cannot independently
change the orchestrator's wiring — that's an orchestration-owner
decision and needs an architecture-doc update.

**Phase 1 surface (broadcast policy).** `AppEvent` fan-out uses
`broadcast::channel(256)` (~8 s of meter at 30 Hz). Slow subscribers
receive `RecvError::Lagged` from tokio and must warn at their call site;
the orchestrator does not pre-emptively drop subscribers. Meeting
titles use the placeholder convention `"Recording {ISO-8601 start
timestamp}"` until Phase 3/4 rename support lands.

### `settings`
**Crate:** `crates/settings`
**Owns:** the settings schema, validation, change notifications.
Backed by a single JSON file (`{app-data}/settings.store`) read/written via
`serde_json` + `std::fs`; the resolved `PathBuf` is injected by `app-main` at
construction time (no `tauri::*` in this crate). Change notifications use a
`tokio::sync::watch` channel (capacity 1; subscribers always see the latest
value) broadcast directly from `SettingsHandle::update` — not via the
orchestrator.

Single source of truth for runtime configuration. Other components read
settings via this crate; nobody else parses the store directly.

### `ipc-bridge`
**Crate:** `crates/ipc-bridge`
**Owns:** the Tauri command + event surface. tauri-specta generates
TypeScript types consumed by the webview.

**The only crate that knows about Tauri APIs.** Every other crate is
free of Tauri imports — this is what makes the core testable without a
running Tauri app.

**Phase 1 command surface (8 commands, all `async fn` returning `Result<T, IpcError>`):**
`list_devices`, `start_recording`, `pause_recording`, `resume_recording`,
`stop_recording`, `get_recording_state`, `get_settings`, `update_settings`.

**Event forwarding:** `spawn_event_forwarder` starts a tokio task that subscribes
to the orchestrator broadcast and emits `AppEventPayload` (event name
`"app-event-payload"`) to all windows.

**tauri-specta pin verified (Q-P1-2):** `tauri-specta = "=2.0.0-rc.21"`,
`specta = "=2.0.0-rc.22"`, `specta-typescript = "0.0.9"` compile cleanly with
`tauri = "2.10"`. No version conflict.

**Type mirror pattern:** `common` and `settings` types do not derive
`specta::Type` (those crates have no `specta` dependency). Mirror types in
`crates/ipc-bridge/src/specta_types.rs` carry identical serde shapes and the
required derives. An architecture-owner commit adding `specta::Type` to
`common` / `settings` can remove the mirror layer.

### `app-main` (bin)
**Crate:** `src-tauri/` (Tauri convention)
**Owns:** the Tauri main binary, tray icon, window management, process
lifetime. Wires the components into a running app.

The thinnest crate — code here should mostly be construction and
plumbing.

**Tracing:** file appender at `{app-data}/logs/meeting-app.log`, rotated
daily, 7-day retention via startup cleanup. Console layer in debug builds
only. `RUST_LOG`-style filtering via `EnvFilter::from_default_env()`.

**Tray menu:** "Open meeting-app" (show/focus main window) + "Quit"
(`app.exit(0)`). Left-click on the tray icon shows the main window.
Window close intercepts `CloseRequested` and hides rather than exits.

**Bindings harness:** `cargo run -p meeting-app --bin generate-bindings`
(alias: `cargo gen-bindings`) writes `ui/src/ipc/bindings.ts` without
starting the GUI. Run after any `ipc-bridge` command/event surface change.

## Webview components

The webview is small enough that ownership maps to directories rather
than packages.

| Component | Lives in | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Notes editor | `ui/src/editor/` | Tiptap editor, markdown shortcuts, paragraph-anchor extension. |
| Transcript pane | `ui/src/transcript/` | Live-appending transcript view, hover/click cross-reference. |
| Meeting shell | `ui/src/shell/` | Window chrome, start/stop/pause, audio meter, meeting list. |
| IPC client | `ui/src/ipc/` | Typed wrapper around `invoke` + `listen`. Generated stubs from tauri-specta live here. |
| UI state store | `ui/src/state/` | Zustand store. Derived UI state only — transient. |

The webview's source of truth for typed messages is the generated
`bindings.ts` produced by tauri-specta. Hand-edits to that file are not
allowed.

**Phase 1 implementation notes (Stream G).**
The Zustand store shape is defined in `ui/src/state/recording.ts` as
`RecordingStore` with fields `state`, `devices`, `selectedDeviceId`,
`meter`, and `lastError` plus async action methods and a synchronous
`handleEvent` dispatcher. The global `"app-event-payload"` event listener
is mounted once in `App.tsx` via the `useAppEventBridge` hook
(`ui/src/shell/event-listener.tsx`); it must not be placed inside a
conditionally-rendered subtree. The Vite dev server runs on port 5173
(matching `tauri.conf.json` `devUrl`).

## What lives where — quick reference

- **Editing audio capture buffer size:** `audio-capture` crate.
- **Tweaking VAD silence threshold:** `vad-chunker` crate + `settings`
  schema.
- **Changing ASR prompt template:** `asr-runtime` crate.
- **Changing summarisation system prompt default:** `settings` crate +
  `summariser` prompt builder.
- **Adding a new meeting metadata field:** `common` (type), `persistence`
  (storage), `ipc-bridge` (surface).
- **Adding a new Tauri command:** `ipc-bridge` crate. tauri-specta
  regenerates the TS bindings.
- **Adding a new event from backend to webview:** `ipc-bridge` defines
  the event; `orchestrator` (or the relevant crate) emits via an
  abstraction in `common`.
